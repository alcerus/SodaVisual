Hi Sam, 

This is the project I've made from the files that Mr. Liam McMenamin shared with me. Most of my experience with web was to scope, develop pilot websites and make sure that the external agencies that were working with us, were delivering according to the scope of work. 

I have worked with bootstrap/saas but never had to develop responsive templates for different platforms. It was all the opposite, always had to develop backwards to make things work even for IE6/7 (I guess you know the struggle). 

All I know was selftaught, I learn fast and adapt quickly but I need support to fill some gaps. I am sure the way I developed the site is not following some of the best practices. If you want someone committed, that's me. 

We can talk directly if you want to know more about me. @alcerus, alcerus@hotmail.com or 07491135753.

Thanks for you time!

Alberto RS.
